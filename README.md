## ðŸš€ EASY P2P IS HERE!

---

I created this amazing library to make life easier for everyone who wants to build a server-based game or application **for free** that works **always**.

My goal was to create a library that is:

- Free  
- Registration-free  
- Serverless  
- Easy to understand even for programming beginners

And in the end, I made exactly that library!  
# Itâ€™s amazing!! âœ¨

With my library, you can create a mini messenger or even a multiplayer game â€”  
(which, I repeat, will work **ALL THE TIME!!**)

# PLANS FOR THE FUTURE:
- Remove the dependency on JSON for offer and answer data  
- Remove or make optional the need for offer and answer at all  
- Minimize data exchange between users (for example, reduce connection ID transfer) to zero
